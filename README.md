## Introduction
**Online Special Tic-Tac-Toe** is a full-stack web application that enhances the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game by introducing a twist: each player can only place 3 X's or O's, making the game more dynamic and reducing the likelihood of a draw. The project is built with React.js, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, and StreamChat services.

## Features
- User signup/login functionality.
- Secure password handling with bcrypt.
- Responsive UI powered by React.js.
- RESTful API built with Express.js.
- Real-time chat functionality using StreamChat.
- Game Invitations: Send and receive game invitations to challenge friends.
- Online Multiplayer: Play against other players in real-time.
- Channel-Based Gameplay: Join or create channels to play games with other players.
- Real-Time Updates: Receive updates on the game board and player moves in real-time.
